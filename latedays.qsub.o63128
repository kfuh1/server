*** The results are correct! ***

Avg request latency:  3612.99 ms
Total test time:      189.29 sec
Workers booted:       3
Compute used:         464.47 sec

----------------------------------------------------------------
Grade: 3 of 12 points
         + 2 points for correctness
         + 5 points for perf
         - 4 points for worker usage

         2.2% of project idea requests met the 4100 ms latency requirement
         98.8% of tellmenow requests met the 150 ms latency requirement
         57.1% of all other requests met the 2500 ms latency requirement
----------------------------------------------------------------

Grading Details:
  Perf:  * You get 30 credits per project idea response under 4100 ms.
         * You get 5 credits per tellmenow response under 150 ms.
         * You get 1 credit for all other responses under 2500 ms.
         * Perf points are: 10 * (num_credits / max_credits) / 0.9
              (the 0.9 is for slop: only 90\% of reponses must meet threshold)

  Usage: * No resource penalty up to 350 CPU-seconds.
         * Linear falloff to minus 50% of perf points at 475 sec
